Party Line is a decentralized peer to peer chat app with message integrity ~~and end to end encryption~~. 

Main Line is the primary chat and control channel for the application. Things aren't encrypted in Main Line because the chat is global. Messages are signed and verifiable for [integrity porpoises](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Delfinekko.gif).

Party Lines are sub chats, established between a set of peers. These chats have end to end encryption and file transfer capabilities. 

**Warning - Currently opens ports on your router and doesn't close them.**

## Getting Started

`npm install`

`node partyline.js`

## Usage

1. Get an active peer's bootstrap ID

2. Start the client

3. `/bootstrap <peer id>`

4. Happy chatting!

## FAIRLY ARDUOUS QUESTS

**Why should I not trust Main Line?**

It's full of people like you. 

**Are Party Lines secure?**

Party Lines rely on you trusting all individuals participating in that Party Line. Don't invite a loose lipped leaker to your parties. Other than that they're pretty legit. Speak freely about your plots and schemes, send noodles, share your rarest memes.

**When's the ICO?**

Digital "assets" that lack monetary policy will never be realized as mainstream currencies. 

**B-b-but muh Bitcoin debit card?**

That's just a passthrough gimmick for spending money in USD. You also pay taxes in USD. Thanks for your continued support of the one true currency.

**Is this the blockchain?**

Yea, fuck it, why not?

**Is this Tor?**

No. While your messages in Main Line will often route through other users, routing tables are public which contain your ID, IP, and port. Since you sign all your messages with your key and ID, it is not unrealistic that people could figure out which IP is posting which messages.

**Is this just a shitty Javascript knockoff of 9gridchan?**

Yes.

**Will you accept my pull request for an Electron front-end?**

Yes, thank you. Strategic decisions like this will help us along our path to a billion dollar IPO. Who needs RAM when you have servants?
